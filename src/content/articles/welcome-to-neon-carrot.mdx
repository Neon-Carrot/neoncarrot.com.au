Hello, thanks for stopping by! We're genuinely thrilled to have you here, getting a little sneak peek at our business. So whoever you are, and wherever you're coming from, thanks for visiting! üôè

We're here to share a bit about us and why we're doing what we're doing. Neon Carrot is an IT consultancy dedicated to serving not-for-profits. We're on a mission to maximise their impacts using digital technology, hoping to make a real difference in the sector, one solution at a time!

We're also here to announce the launch of our [articles](/articles) page üöÄ! Tailored for the not-for-profit sector, this space will be used to offer insights on tech topics like AI, cybersecurity and cloud computing, provide how-to guides on software and project management processes, showcase case studies of previous projects, and many other things. For our first post though, it's going to be all about us!

## So, who are we?

Neon Carrot is made up of Caleb (that's me!) and Carol - partners in business and in ~~crime~~ life. The company was formed in 2020, amidst a global pandemic that upended modern society and catapulted hidden social inequities into view. During that wild time, we figured we could use our skills in IT and project management to actually help people - _real_ people with _real_ problems. And what started out as a passion project that we contributed to on the side has now evolved into our full-time vocation and top priority!

üëã Hi! I'm Caleb, a software engineer and IT consultant who has worked in the tech space for more than 7 years.

I love the rapidly evolving nature of the tech industry, how it demands an attitude of continuous learning and adaptation, and how much you can accomplish in the world of software, especially in the AI era. I am also a huge advocate of open-source technology, which I believe drives innovation and empowers all - it's incredible the wealth of knowledge and cutting-edge tech available to use even as an individual!

Having previously worked at Canonical, which has developed some of the world's most influential open source projects, I wanted to take a step further into using technology for positive change, and working with not-for-profits directly allows for just that. It's one of those rare things where the work doesn't feel like work! It just feels good. üòä

<h3 class="heading-4 center">Carolina Fonseca</h3>

üëã Hi there! I'm Carol, a passionate business analyst and IT consultant with a knack for bridging the gap between business needs and technological solutions.

With over a decade involved in the not-for-profit sector, my journey started with a pivotal volunteering experience as a call centre operator at the RSPCA. This is what sparked my commitment to contributing to something greater than myself and fostering community connections.

Throughout my experience in the not-for-profit sector, I witnessed the sector's hurdles firsthand, grappling with inefficient systems that don't capture valuable information or measure impact. That's where my passion for tech began - I saw its potential to empower staff, guide decision-making and amplify impact.

## But what can we actually do?

We specialise in a range of IT consulting services, including:

- Developing modern, engaging and accessible websites and applications;
- Managing cloud services, with a focus on the Microsoft Azure suite;
- Creating live data dashboards that transform complex data into actionable insights;
- Developing and delivering tech training material;
- ‚Ä¶and many other things. Trust me! IT consulting is a never-ending labyrinth of ideas, solutions and software - what's important is exploring problems or opportunities and finding the right technology to tackle them. Sometimes the best move forward doesn't involve a fancy tech solution at all! ü´£

Having experience in the social sector ourselves, we understand some of the unique needs and challenges of not-for-profits (code for ‚Äúendlessly having to do more with less‚Äù). Our approach is grounded in fully understanding each client's needs and goals, and providing the absolute best possible value, regardless of budget. We aim to provide solutions that are not only innovative but also practical and sustainable, ensuring not-for-profits achieve their goals effectively and efficiently.

## Now that you know a bit about us‚Ä¶

Reach out! Whether you represent a not-for-profit seeking innovative tech solutions or you're an individual passionate about making a positive impact through technology, we're here to collaborate, support, and innovate together! Contact us at [info@neoncarrot.com.au](mailto:info@neoncarrot.com.au) or by using the [contact form on our homepage](/#contact) to find out more about how we can work together.

Thanks for reading! üëã
