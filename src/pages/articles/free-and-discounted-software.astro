        Hello, friends! üëã At Neon Carrot, we're all about empowering the
        not-for-profit sector with digital technology, so let's dive into the
        world of software offerings that are either free or discounted for
        not-for-profits!
      </p>
      <h2>General process for accessing the software</h2>
      <p>
        Getting your hands on these resources is simpler than you might think,
        though keep in mind it may take a bit of time for your organisation's
        eligibility to be confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by visiting the ‚Äúnot-for-profit‚Äù/‚Äùnonprofit‚Äù section of the
        software provider's website - a link has been included for each offering
        mentioned here. You'll need to pass an eligibility test, which usually
        constitutes filling out an online form with details about the operation
        of your not-for-profit. Common requirements for eligibility are that
        your organisation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Is recognised as a not-for-profit organisation in the country in which
          you are registered. In Australia this would require registering with
          the <a href="https://www.acnc.gov.au/"
            >ACNC (Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission)</a
          >;
        </li>
        <li>
          Does not discriminate against, marginalise or exclude any person or
          group on the basis of personal characteristics or attributes;
        </li>
        <li>
          Does not advocate for or against any political party, candidate, or
          campaign.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other eligibility requirements will vary between software providers, so
        be sure to double-check them before you apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your application is approved, you should be credited with whatever
        discount was on offer! Easy as that!
      </p>
      <h2>Our recommendations</h2>
      <p>
        Without further ado, here is a list of software offerings that we think
        could really help elevate your impact:
      </p>

          width={673}
          widths={[673, 412]}
        />
      </div>
      <h3 class="heading-4">

          >Microsoft 365</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        This one's a no-brainer, and you might already be part of the <a
          href="https://www.infoxchange.org/sites/default/files/infoxchanges_2023_digital_technology_in_the_not-for-profit_sector_report.pdf"
          >46% of Australian/New Zealand not-for-profits</a
        > already using Microsoft 365 for your file storage, collaboration and productivity
        needs - let's just hope you're not paying full-price!
      </p>
      <p>
        Microsoft 365 is a subscription service that includes familiar apps like
        Word, PowerPoint, Excel and Outlook, as well as the collaboration
        platform Teams and cloud storage with OneDrive. Their Business Basic
        tier is very generous, which includes the apps I just mentioned, 1TB of
        cloud storage and Teams for up to 300 attendees, all for the price of
        <em>literally nothing</em> if you're an eligible not-for-profit. They offer
        discounts on higher-tier plans too, but honestly you can go pretty far just
        with the free offering.
      </p>
      <p>

        <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/workspace/"
          >Google Workspace</a
        >
      </h3>
      <p>
        If Microsoft isn't your jam, Google also has a similar offering with
        their Workspace suite of tools, which includes Gmail, Calendar, Meet,
        Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms and a couple other apps (that no one uses
        üò¨). Google also offers a free-tier for not-or-profits which includes
        100-participant video meetings on Meet and 100TB of shared data in
        Drive. Like 365, there are huge discounts on higher-tier plans if the
        free-tier doesn't get you what you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        We ourselves at Neon Carrot use Google Workspace, partially due to
        inertia from already using their tools in our earlier professional
        lives, but also because their user interfaces are just that little bit
        slicker than Microsoft's (in our opinion). Nevertheless, you can't go
        wrong with either option.

        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/azure"
          >Microsoft Azure</a

      </h3>
      <p>
        I swear we're not shilling for Microsoft! It's just hard to argue with
        their efforts to enable not-for-profit missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Azure is Microsoft's platform for cloud services, which includes tools
        for hosting websites, analysing data and using AI for automation, among
        a ridiculous number of other services. Currently, Microsoft offers
        eligible not-for-profits a yearly recurring USD$2000 grant as well as
        free/discounted rates on individual cloud services. It can be difficult
        to determine what <em>exactly</em> USD$2000 gets you (cloud pricing is notoriously
        complicated), but in most situations it sure beats managing your own IT infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the interest of fairness, <a
          href="https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/nonprofits/"
          >Amazon Web Services (AWS) also provides USD$1000 credit for eligible
          not-for-profits</a
        >, but I personally find Amazon's design tendency toward ‚Äúinformation
        density‚Äù and Amazon-specific acronyms to be a bit unintuitive and
        intimidating, and issues with pricing ambiguity are even more
        pronounced. That's not to say Azure is a work of pure clarity, but in my
        experience it's a bit more user-friendly.

      </h3>
      <p>
        Canva is an online design and publishing tool that enables users to
        create a variety of visual content, including graphic design,
        presentations, posters and documents. It's aimed towards individuals who
        want to create visually appealing content but who may not have advanced
        design skills, owing to its frankly <em>ludicrous</em> amount of templates
        on offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Canva's free tier is already insanely good value, but eligible
        not-for-profits can get access to their ‚ÄúCanva for Teams‚Äù tier for free
        too. This includes premium templates, 100+ million stock photos, videos,
        and graphics, generative AI features and 1TB of cloud storage, among
        many other things. Unless you're doing some really custom design work,
        Canva's premium features will be more than enough to cover your
        not-for-profit's online presence, marketing and fundraising design
        needs.

        <Picture
          alt="Adobe Express app homepage"
          class="image"
          formats={["webp"]}
          height={379}

      </div>
      <h3 class="heading-4">
        <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/nonprofits">Adobe Express</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Like Canva, Adobe Express is a web-based application for graphic design,
        video editing and creating web pages, whose main draw is its
        user-friendliness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eligible not-for-profits can receive the Adobe Express Premium plan for
        free üéâ, which includes all premium templates and design assets, over
        20,000 licensed fonts from the Adobe Fonts library, over 160 million
        Adobe Stock collection photos, and 100GB of cloud storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would say that for the average non-designer, Canva is the more
        feature-rich and user-friendly of the two, but if your organisation is
        already in the Adobe ecosystem, Express is a great resource. And how can
        you say no to ‚Äúfree‚Äù? I should also mention that Adobe offers <a
          href="https://www.connectingup.org/partner/adobe-charity-licensing"
          >discounts for not-for-profits on its full Creative Cloud suite</a
        >, which includes much more sophisticated and heavy-duty design software
        than what you get with either Canva or Express. Something to keep in
        mind for when your not-for-profit's design needs grow!

        <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/teams/nonprofits">Atlassian</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Atlassian's suite of project management and productivity tools are
        ubiquitous and well-regarded in the software development world. Whether
        your team follows Agile, Scrum, Kanban, or some sort of glued-together
        Franken-methodology that works for you (this is how it always ends up),
        Atlassian's tools can fit your project management needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eligible not-for-profit organisations are offered 75% off Atlassian's
        teamwork tools, including Jira, Trello, Confluence and Atlas. Whether
        you're driving fundraising campaigns, delivering programs, managing
        volunteers, or communicating your impact, Atlassian's tools help you
        stay organised.
      </p>
      <p>
        We at Neon Carrot use Trello extensively, to track general business
        tasks as well as when working with clients to deliver projects. For us,
        it offers just the right amount of ease-of-use and flexibility to be
        effective without being overwhelming.

      <h2>Explore even more free and discounted resources</h2>
      <p>
