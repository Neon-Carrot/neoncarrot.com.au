        Hello, thanks for stopping by! We're genuinely thrilled to have you
        here, getting a little sneak peek at our business. So whoever you are,
        and wherever you're coming from, thanks for visiting! üôè
      </p>
      <p>
        We're here to share a bit about us and why we're doing what we're doing.
        Neon Carrot is an IT consultancy dedicated to serving not-for-profits.
        We're on a mission to maximise their impacts using digital technology,
        hoping to make a real difference in the sector, one solution at a time!
      </p>
      <p>
        We're also here to announce the launch of our
        <a href="/articles">articles</a> page üöÄ! Tailored for the not-for-profit
        sector, this space will be used to offer insights on tech topics like AI,
        cybersecurity and cloud computing, provide how-to guides on software and
        project management processes, showcase case studies of previous projects,
        and many other things. For our first post though, it's going to be all about
        us!
      </p>
      <h2>So, who are we?</h2>
      <p>
        Neon Carrot is made up of Caleb (that's me!) and Carol - partners in
        business and in <s>crime</s> life. The company was formed in 2020, amidst
        a global pandemic that upended modern society and catapulted hidden social
        inequities into view. During that wild time, we figured we could use our
        skills in IT and project management to actually help people -
        <em>real</em> people with <em>real</em> problems. And what started out as
        a passion project that we contributed to on the side has now evolved into
        our full-time vocation and top priority!

      <p>
        üëã Hi! I'm Caleb, a software engineer and IT consultant who has worked
        in the tech space for more than 7 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love the rapidly evolving nature of the tech industry, how it demands
        an attitude of continuous learning and adaptation, and how much you can
        accomplish in the world of software, especially in the AI era. I am also
        a huge advocate of open-source technology, which I believe drives
        innovation and empowers all - it's incredible the wealth of knowledge
        and cutting-edge tech available to use even as an individual!
      </p>
      <p>
        Having previously worked at Canonical, which has developed some of the
        world's most influential open source projects, I wanted to take a step
        further into using technology for positive change, and working with
        not-for-profits directly allows for just that. It's one of those rare
        things where the work doesn't feel like work! It just feels good. üòä

      <h4 class="center">Carolina Fonseca</h4>
      <p>
        üëã Hi there! I'm Carol, a passionate business analyst and IT consultant
        with a knack for bridging the gap between business needs and
        technological solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        With over a decade involved in the not-for-profit sector, my journey
        started with a pivotal volunteering experience as a call centre operator
        at the RSPCA. This is what sparked my commitment to contributing to
        something greater than myself and fostering community connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my experience in the not-for-profit sector, I witnessed the
        sector's hurdles firsthand, grappling with inefficient systems that
        don't capture valuable information or measure impact. That's where my
        passion for tech began - I saw its potential to empower staff, guide
        decision-making and amplify impact.
      </p>
      <h2>But what can we actually do?</h2>
      <p>We specialise in a range of IT consulting services, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developing modern, engaging and accessible websites and applications;
        </li>
        <li>
          Managing cloud services, with a focus on the Microsoft Azure suite;
        </li>
        <li>
          Creating live data dashboards that transform complex data into
          actionable insights;
        </li>
        <li>Developing and delivering tech training material;</li>
        <li>
          ‚Ä¶and many other things. Trust me! IT consulting is a never-ending
          labyrinth of ideas, solutions and software - what's important is
          exploring problems or opportunities and finding the right technology
          to tackle them. Sometimes the best move forward doesn't involve a
          fancy tech solution at all! ü´£
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Having experience in the social sector ourselves, we understand some of
        the unique needs and challenges of not-for-profits (code for ‚Äúendlessly
        having to do more with less‚Äù). Our approach is grounded in fully
        understanding each client's needs and goals, and providing the absolute
        best possible value, regardless of budget. We aim to provide solutions
        that are not only innovative but also practical and sustainable,
        ensuring not-for-profits achieve their goals effectively and
        efficiently.
